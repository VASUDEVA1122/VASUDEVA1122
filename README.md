//You know, back in the day, saving the world required a suit of armor. Now? It just takes this

app.listen(3000, () => {
 console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

// This serverâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t just run. It listens. On port 3000. And just like me, itâ€™s always ready to handle whatever you throw at it. Because I love youâ€¦ 3000.

//Cue epic music. ðŸŽµ
